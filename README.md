# DevOps Bootcamp

This repo is my personal journey through a DevOps learning roadmap.  
It’s a mix of weekly notes, handy cheat sheets, scripts, and experiments I build along the way.  
Nothing here is meant to be “perfect” — it’s a living notebook as I level up.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- **notes/**  
  Weekly notes, organized by week. Each folder holds what I learned that week.

- **cheatsheets/**  
  Quick reference guides (e.g. Linux commands, Git tips, Docker basics, etc.).

- **scripts/**  
  Small utilities, practice scripts, and automation snippets.

- **experiments/**  
  Sandboxed tests, configs, and random stuff I’m trying out.

## 🚀 Goal

To build solid DevOps fundamentals by *doing*, not just reading.  
This repo is both a study log and a toolkit I can come back to anytime.

## ⚡ How to Use

- Browse `notes/` if you want to follow along week by week.  
- Jump into `cheatsheets/` if you just need quick commands.  
- Check `scripts/` for runnable practice code.  
- `experiments/` is where things may break — that’s the point.

## 📌 Status

Currently working through **Week 2**. Repo will keep growing as I progress.
